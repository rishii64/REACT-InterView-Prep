# React interview prepration session - EA25
## Day - 1 
### Q1. What is SPA ( Single Page Application) 
- SPA stands for Single Page Application, and it's a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. React is a popular JavaScript library for building SPAs.
- A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads all of its content on a single HTML page. This is in contrast to traditional web applications, which load a new HTML page for each new view. SPAs are more responsive and user-friendly, as users do not have to wait for new pages to load every time they interact with the application.
- In a React SPA, the initial HTML page typically only contains a single "div" element, which serves as the entry point for the React application. When the page loads, React renders the initial UI based on the state of the application. As the user interacts with the application, React updates the UI in response to events such as button clicks or form submissions.

###### One advantage of using a React SPA is that it can provide a smoother and more responsive user experience compared to traditional web applications, since the page does not need to reload every time the user interacts with it. However, SPAs can be more complex to build and maintain, since they require more client-side code and may require additional server-side infrastructure to support the API.

### Q2. What is Virtual DOM?

- **DOM** : DOM stands for Document Object Model. Normally, whenever a user requests a webpage, the browser receives an HTML document for that page from the server. The browser then constructs a logical, tree-like structure from the HTML to show the user the requested page in the client.

##### The problem with DOM
DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JavaScript operations. This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to.

### Virtual DOM - 
-   React contains a lightweight representation of real DOM in the memory called Virtual DOM.
-   DOM gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time, Whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time.
-   Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click, then the changes will not directly go to Real Dom.
-   So, we are having two virtual doms, one VDOM gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real DOM.
-   Another VDOM is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values.
-   Now these two virtual DOMs will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes this complete procedure is known as **diffing algorithm.**
-   Now the new changes will be updated in your Real DOM, this procedure is known as **Recoinciliation** This makes a big difference! React can update only the necessary parts of the DOM. Reactâ€™s reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation.

### Q3. What is difference between class and functional component?

|Function-Based Components | Class-Based Components|
|------|------|
|Functional components is a plain JavaScript, you do not have a choice to set the state in functional component.| Class components we have a feature to set the set state in component|
|There is no render function we are using in functional components.| In class components, we have a render function which is use to return the react elements.|
|Function components only accept the props as an arguments.| In class componsnts, we have a render function which is use to return the react elements.|
|Functional components are somethimes called stateless components.| Class components are sometimes called stateful components.|


### H/W - Difference between Props and State?
|Props (Properties) | State | 
|---- | ----- |
|Props is used to send data from one compo to another (Parent to Child) | State is a obj. that represent the internal variable of a component. |
|Props can't be modified | We can modified state using setState function | 
|Props can be used in class and function based components | State can be used only in class based components|
|Props are read-only | State changes can be changed|
|Props are passed outside a componsnts | States are passed inside a components|

### Q4. What is package.json?
1. The package.json file is a crucial part of any Node.js project, including React applications. It's a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that serves as a manifest for your project. In the context of React, it specifies the project's metadata and its dependencies.
   1. Name and Version:
   2. Dependencies:
   3. Scripts:
   4. DevDependencies:

### Q5. What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?
- JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is commonly used in React applications. It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. JSX provides several benefits for building user interfaces, and here's why we use it instead of plain JavaScript:
    1. Declarative Syntax
    2. Readability
    3. Component Composition
    4. Performance Optimization
    5. Ecosystem Support

### Q. 6 What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?

|React JS | React-Native|
|---- | ----|
|JS Library | Mobile Framework|
|Use to build web application | use to build cross-plateform mobile application.|
|V-DOM render data on browser | Native API for mobile components rendering|
|create robust animation using CSS | Need to use API for create animation |

### H/W Q7. Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component?

| Statfull| Stateless |
|----| ----- |

### Q8. What do you know about NPM?
- NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, a popular runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of web browsers. It is a fundamental tool in the JavaScript ecosystem and plays a crucial role in managing packages and dependencies for Node.js applications. Here is an overview of what NPM is and what it's used for:
  1. Package Management
  2. Dependency Management
  3. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
  4. Scripts
  5. Security
  6. Open Source and Community

## Day - 2


### Q1. What is an event in react?
- An event in React is an action that is triggered by the user or the system. For example, a mouse click, keyboard press, or window resize are all events. React has its own event handling system, which is known as **Synthetic Events**. Synthetic Events are cross-browser wrappers of the browser's native events, which means that they have the same interface and behavior across all browsers.
- To handle events in React, you use event handlers. Event handlers are functions that are passed to React elements as props. When the event is triggered, the function is called with an event object as the argument. The event object contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the target element, and any additional data.
  
- Here are some examples of common events in React:
  - onClick: Fired when the user clicks an element.
  - onChange: Fired when the user changes the value of an input element.
  - onSubmit: Fired when the user submits a form.
  - onKeyPress: Fired when the user presses a key on the keyboard.
  - onMouseOver: Fired when the user moves the mouse cursor over an element.
  - onMouseOut: Fired when the user moves the mouse cursor away from an element.

### Q2. What is the package name you are using for routing?
- Name of the packege is React Router DOM.
- install => npm install / i react-router-dom

### Q3. Implement Routes with Components name ?
- Home
- Student
  - implement dynamic route in student
- Contact
- About

### Q6. What is lazy loading in react ?
- Lazy loading is a technique in web development that involves loading specific parts of a web application only when they are needed. In the context of React.js, it allows you to load components, modules, or assets asynchronously and on-demand, improving the initial load time and overall performance of your application.
- Why Use Lazy Loading in React?
  - Improves initial page load time.
  - Reduces the size of the initial bundle.
  - Enhances user experience by loading resources on-demand.
  - Optimizes performance for large applications.

- Component used in lazyloading
  - Suspense - 
  - Lazy - import from 'react'

### Q7. H/W Difference between Axios and fetch?
|Axios | Fetch | 
|----- | ------- | 
|3rd Prty Library | JavaScript Method | 
|Automatically transform Data | Have to manually transform data | 
|Has to be compiled | can be read directly by browsers | 
|Need to install externally | No need to install |

# Day - 3

### Q1. What is Props Drilling Concept ?What is State Uplifting?
- **Prop Drilling**: Prop drilling, also known as "prop passing," is a common issue in React applications. It occurs when you need to pass data through multiple levels of nested components, even if some of the intermediary components don't use that data. It can make your code less maintainable and harder to understand.
- **State Lifting**: State lifting is the process of moving state up the component hierarchy to a common ancestor or a higher-level component where it can be shared by multiple child components that need access to the same data. This makes it easier to manage and update the shared state.
- Benefits of State Lifting:
  - Simplified Code: State lifting reduces redundancy in your code and makes it easier to manage, as you don't have to pass props through many levels of components.
  - Improved Performance: Avoiding prop drilling can improve the performance of your application, as React doesn't need to re-render components unnecessarily.
  - Easier Maintenance: When you need to modify the state or data, you only need to do it in one place (the common ancestor) rather than making changes in multiple child components.

### Q2. Fetch API data using Axios?

### Q3. Context API?
- The Context API is a powerful feature in React that allows you to manage and share state data between components without having to pass props down through every level of your component tree. It's especially useful for scenarios where multiple components need access to the same data.
- Context API is a built-in feature in React that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It allows you to share data between components, such as theme information, user authentication, or any other global data.
- **When to Use Context API?**
  - You should consider using the Context API when you have data that needs to be accessed by multiple components at different levels of the component tree. It simplifies data sharing and avoids "prop drilling."
    - A Provider component is used to wrap the part of your component tree where you want to share data. It accepts a value prop, which will provide the shared data to its child components.
    -  you can use the useContext hook to access the context data more conveniently.

### Q4. What is UseState Hook ?(Implementation)
- useState is a built-in hook in React.js that allows you to add state to functional components. State is a way to store and manage data that can change over time, and it's a crucial concept in React as it enables your components to re-render when the state changes. With useState, you can create and manage state variables within your functional components.
- S : 
  - const [state variable name, state function name] = useState(default value of state variable)

### Q5. What is useEffect Hook ?(Implementation)
- useEffect is a built-in hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects typically involve tasks such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscribing to external events. useEffect is a critical part of React because it helps you manage the side effects of your components.
- **useEffect** : 
  - useEffect takes two arguments: a function and an array of dependencies.
  - The function inside useEffect is where you place your side effect code.
  - The dependencies array is optional. If provided, the effect will only be re-run when the values in this array change. 

### Q6. Do you know about SEO ? Is it true that react js supports SEO support?
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a set of techniques and strategies used to improve a website's visibility in search engine results. The primary goal of SEO is to attract organic (non-paid) traffic to a website and increase its ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs).
- is it true that react js support SEO 
  - React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, was once criticized for its initial lack of SEO support because it primarily renders content on the client-side. However, there have been significant improvements in making React applications more SEO-friendly.
  - React applications can implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to improve SEO. SSR pre-renders React components on the server and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client. This allows search engines to crawl and index the content.


## Day - 4

### Q1. Difference between callback and useCallback Hook?
- A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous operations, event handling, and other scenarios where you want to specify what should happen after a certain task is done.
- The useCallback hook is part of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to memoize functions and optimize performance in React components.
- The primary purpose of useCallback is to avoid unnecessary re-rendering of child components in React when a parent component re-renders. It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments, and it returns a memoized version of the function. This memoized function remains the same between renders unless one of the dependencies has changed.
- useCallback is a React Hook that returns a memoized callback function. Memoization is a technique for caching the results of a function so that they can be reused later without having to recalculate them. This can improve performance, especially when the function is expensive to compute.
- **Difference between callback and useCallback** - 
  - The main difference between a callback and a useCallback hook is that a callback is simply a function that is passed as an argument to another function, while useCallback is a React Hook that returns a memoized callback function. This means that a callback can be any function, while a useCallback hook can only be used to memoize a callback function.
  - Another difference is that a callback is typically used to handle events or to pass data between components, while useCallback is typically used to prevent child components from re-rendering unnecessarily.

### Q2. What is useMemo Hooks?
- - useMemo is one of the built-in hooks in React that allows you to optimize the performance of your application by memoizing the results of expensive function calls. It is particularly useful when you have a function that computes a value, and you want to cache and reuse that value unless some dependencies change. This can help reduce unnecessary recalculations, especially when dealing with computationally intensive tasks or rendering components.
- **The useMemo hook takes two arguments:**
    1. A function that computes the memoized value.
    2. An array of dependencies. These dependencies determine when the memoized value should be recalculated. If any of the dependencies change, the memoized value will be recalculated; otherwise, it will be reused.

### Q3. Why do we need keys in react less?
- In React, keys are special attributes that provide a way to identify and differentiate between elements in a list. Each element in an array should have a unique key. React uses keys to efficiently update the user interface by identifying which elements have changed or been added/removed when rendering lists.
- **The Problem Without Keys**
  - Without keys, when React re-renders a list, it has no way to determine which elements have changed or where new items have been inserted. This can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior.
- **The Solution with Keys**
  - By providing unique keys to elements in a list, React can accurately track changes. When React re-renders a list, it will compare the keys of the new elements to the previous ones, allowing it to update, reorder, or remove elements effectively.
- **When to Use Keys**
  - When rendering dynamic lists or arrays in React components.
  - When dealing with lists that may change over time, such as when items are added, removed, or reordered.

### Q4. What is UseRef Hook ?
- The useRef hook is a powerful  tool in React.js that allows you to create and manage references to DOM elements or any mutable values in a functional component. It is especially useful for accessing, interacting with, and tracking changes to DOM elements, implementing animations, and more.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Managing DOM elements.
  - Implementing animations and transitions.
  - Storing and accessing previous state values.
  - Integrating with third-party libraries.

### Q5. What is UseReducer Hook ?(Implementation)
- The useReducer hook is a built-in hook in React that is used for managing more complex state logic in functional components. It is often an alternative to the useState hook when you need to handle state changes in a more structured and predictable way. useReducer follows the principles of the Redux library and can help you manage state in a more predictable and centralized manner.
- **When to Use useReducer?**
  - Use useReducer when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values, or when the next state depends on the previous state.
  - It is a good choice when your state transitions are not simple and straightforward.
  - It can be beneficial in scenarios where you need to pass down state management to child components.
  - Use it when you want to centralize your state logic and maintain a single source of truth.

- **Basic Syntax**
```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
const [state, dispatch - setState] = useReducer((logic, action), 0)
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

```
  - **state**: The current state.
  - **dispatch**: A function used to dispatch actions to update the state.
  - **reducer**: A function that specifies how the state should be updated.
  - **initialState**: The initial state value.

### Q6. Difference between useEffect and useContext ?
- **useEffect** is a React Hook that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. Side effects typically include data fetching, DOM manipulation, or setting up subscriptions.
  - The first argument to useEffect is a function that contains the code to execute when the component renders.
  - The second argument is an array of dependencies. When any of the dependencies change, the effect will run again.
- **useContext** is a React Hook used for accessing and consuming a Context object. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- **Key Differences**:
  - useEffect is used for managing side effects within a component, while useContext is used for consuming context data provided by a parent component.
  - useEffect takes two arguments: a function with side effects and an array of dependencies to control when the effect runs. useContext takes a single argument, the Context object, and returns the current context value.
  - useEffect is primarily used for managing asynchronous operations and side effects, while useContext is used for sharing data (such as global state) across components.

|useEffect Hooks | useContext Hooks|
|------| -------| 
|useEffect is used for managing side effects within a component. | useContext is used for consuming context data provided by a parent component.|
|useEffect takes two arguments: a function with side effects and an array of dependencies to control when the effect runs. | useContext takes a single argument, the Context object, and returns the current context value.|
|useEffect is primarily used for managing asynchronous operations and side effects. | useContext is used for sharing data (such as global state) across components.|

### Q1. High Order Component in react js? 
- A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props and behavior. In other words, it's a way to wrap a component with some logic to enhance or modify its functionality.
- Higher-order components (HOCs) are a powerful feature of React that allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components. A HOC is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component. The new component can add additional functionality to the original component without modifying its code.
- **Why use HOCs in React?**
  - HOCs provide a way to reuse component logic and share code between different parts of your application. They help in abstracting complex logic and make components more focused on their main task. 
  - **Some common use cases for HOCs include:** 
    - **Code Reuse:** HOCs allow you to extract and reuse common code, such as data fetching or authentication logic, across multiple components.
    - **Props Manipulation:** You can add, modify, or filter props passed to a component.
    - **State Management:** HOCs can manage and pass down state to the wrapped components.
    - **Conditional Rendering:** You can control when and how a component renders based on certain conditions.

### Q2. What are React Life cycles Explain each one with Example?
- **Mounting:** 
  - **constructor()**
    - The constructor is called when an instance of a component is being created and initialized.
    - It's used to set the initial state to the component.
  - **Super()**
    - The super() keyword in React is used to call the constructor of the parent class. This is required when you need to access some variables from the parent class. The reason why this cannot be allowed before super() is because this is uninitialized if super() is not called.
  - **render()**
    - The render method returns the JSX to be displayed on the screen.
    - It must be a pure function, meaning it should not have side effects.
  - **componentDidMount()**
    - This method is called after the component is rendered on the screen.
    - It's often used to perform tasks like making API requests or setting up subscriptions.
- **Updating**
  - **componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)**
    - This method is called after the component is updated.
    - It's useful for reacting to changes in props or state.
    - Be careful not to create infinite loops by updating state within this method.
- **Unmounting**
  - **componentWillUnmount()**
    - This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM.
    - It's used to clean up resources like subscriptions and timers.

- **this** 
  - The this keyword in React refers to the current instance of a component class. It allows you to access the component's props, state, and methods within its class definition.

### Q3. What is memory leak and how to overcome?
- A memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way that memory that is no longer needed is not released. This can lead to performance issues, as the application's memory footprint continuously increases over time.
- **Causes of memory leaks in React**
  - **Event listeners:** If you attach event listeners to elements within your React components, but fail to remove them when the component unmounts, it can lead to memory leaks. This is because the event listeners will continue to hold a reference to the component, preventing it from being garbage collected.
  - **Subscription-based APIs:** If you're using subscription-based APIs, such as WebSocket connections or observables, it's crucial to unsubscribe or close these subscriptions when they're no longer needed. Otherwise, the subscriptions will continue to hold a reference to the component, preventing it from being garbage collected.
  - **Closures:** Closures can also lead to memory leaks if they are not properly managed. For example, if you create a closure that contains a reference to a component, and then that closure is stored outside of the component's lifecycle, the component will not be able to be garbage collected.
- **How to overcome memory leaks in React**
  - **Always remove event listeners when components unmount:** You can do this in the componentWillUnmount lifecycle method for class components, or in the cleanup function returned by the useEffect hook for function components.
  - **Always unsubscribe from subscription-based APIs when they're no longer needed:** You can do this by calling the unsubscribe() method on the subscription object.
  - **Be careful with closures:** Make sure that closures that contain references to components are only stored within the component's lifecycle.

- some additional tips for preventing memory leaks in react.
  - Use the useEffect hook to manage cleanup logic.
  - Use React.createRef() to create refs to DOM elements and other objects.
  - Use the React.memo() function to memoize components, which can help to avoid re-rendering components that don't need to be re-rendered.
  - Use a memory profiling tool to identify and fix memory leaks.

### Q4. Do you know about redux?
- Redux is a state management library often used with React, although it can be used with other JavaScript frameworks or libraries as well. It helps you manage the state of your application in a predictable and centralized way. I'll provide you with detailed notes and runnable examples to help you understand Redux better.
- Redux stores the state of your application in a single object tree. The state tree is immutable, meaning that it cannot be changed directly. Instead, changes to the state tree are made by dispatching actions. Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in your application.
- When an action is dispatched, a reducer function is called to calculate the new state of the application. Reducer functions are pure functions, meaning that they always return the same output for the same input. This ensures that the state tree is always consistent.

- **Redux Basics**
  - **Store:** The store holds the current state of your application. You can think of it as a JavaScript object that contains all the data you need for your app.
  - **Actions:** Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe the type of change you want to make to your state. For example, you might have an action like ADD_TODO to add a new to-do item.
  - **Reducers:** Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as parameters and return the new state.
  - **Dispatch:** To update the state, you dispatch actions to the store using store.dispatch(action). This triggers a state change.
